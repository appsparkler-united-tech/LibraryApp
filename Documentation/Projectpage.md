# The Library App

The Library App is a React-based web application that allows users to store and manage their personal library of books. Each book is associated with a signed-up user and contains essential information like the title, author, genre, language, and more. The app is built using Vite, Firebase Firestore for database storage, and Netlify for deployment.

## Features
- User authentication (Google, Facebook, Phone, or Email/Password) via Firebase.
- Add, edit, and delete books from the userâ€™s library.
- Ability to view and manage book details such as author, title, genre, language, and more.
- Users/Readers can add reviews for each book.
- Supports geolocation or address of where the book was added.

## Constrains for Book Upload

When uploading a book, the following fields are mandatory:

- Title: Must not be empty.
- Genre: Must not be empty. 
- Language: Must not be empty.
